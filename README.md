## ðŸ§  Project: Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### âœ… Objective:
Predict house prices based on area using Linear Regression.

### ðŸ“¦ Dataset:
House_Price.csv (Kaggle)

### ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### ðŸ“Š Steps Followed:
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Selected 'Area' as input and 'Price' as target
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated using MAE, MSE, RÂ² Score
6. Plotted actual vs predicted prices

### ðŸ“ˆ Final Plot:
- Blue: Actual prices
- Red: Predicted price line

### ðŸ“‹ Metrics:
- MAE: 3.25 Lakh (example)
- RÂ² Score: 0.72 (example â€” your real values here)

### âœ… Conclusion:
The model shows a positive correlation between area and price.
It can be used to estimate housing prices in similar conditions.
